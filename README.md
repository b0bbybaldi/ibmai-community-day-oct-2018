## A real-time ML application on IBM Cloud Private for Data

### Introduction

Machine Learning has changed the way businesses operate, and to truly get the benefit of Machine Learning, especially for real-time situations, enterprises need to ensure high throughput and reliability from all components in their solution. Such applications need to plan for extreme compute elasticity & high availability and strategies for dealing with outage free rolling upgrades to be truly successful, i.e. - enterprises need applications that exhibit cloud like characteristics in their own data center private clouds, behind their firewalls. So, how does one go about doing this without the full infrastructure of a Cloud IaaS & Paas at their disposal?

In this session for developers and data scientists, we will walk through a simple, but non-trivial, example of building a cloud-native real-time application that invokes a machine learning model for predictions. We will discuss how ICP for Data can help you train models & deploy scalable scoring services as well as how the Kubernetes based platform can also host your cloud native application & ensure reliability and scale.

### _Stay Tuned - presentation and samples will be published after the event._
